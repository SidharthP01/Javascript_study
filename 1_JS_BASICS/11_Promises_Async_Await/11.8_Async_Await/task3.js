// We have a “regular” function called f. How can you call the async function wait() and use its result inside of f?

async function wait() {
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));

  return 10;
}

function f() {
  // ...what should you write here?
  // we need to call async wait() and wait to get 10
  // remember, we can't use "await"

  wait().then(res => alert(res));
}
f();
